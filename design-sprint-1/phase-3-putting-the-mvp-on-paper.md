# Phase 4: creating and validating the prototype

## Prototyping

Recap the previous day and especially the Storyboard and Platform Questions. Prioritising two or three screens. Delegating and assigning tasks. One person should be the Prototyper, in charge of constructing the prototype. One person should arrange all things that could distract the others. Ensure enough snacks, coffee, lunch, etc. \[2x 15 min\] Do two stand-ups during the day. One just before lunch and one just before entering the final hour.

### Recommended tools for prototyping

Design: Sketch or Figma \(Figma has realtime collaboration\). Prototyping: InVision. Icons: NounProject or FontAwesome. Photos: Unsplash.

### Common Pitfalls

Random new feedback. Second guessing the concept. Not being strict with timeboxing. Distractions from too many people checking ins. Not prioritising early. Too many people in the room. No-one to support with food and drinks etc.

## Interviewing

Have two participants from the previous parts do the interviews. One is Interviewer and one is Note Taker. Make interviewee feel at ease. Tell them we are not testing them, but testing the prototype.

Create a table with on the horizontal header the names of the interviewees and on the vertical headers the names of the prototype screens. Make interviewee feel at ease. Tell them we are not testing them, but testing the prototype. Follow the flow of the headers.

Let them examine each screen and think out loud. After they are “done” with a screen, guide them towards the next screen \(they might try to click on stuff that do not work in prototype\). The Note Taker has two sets of post-its: green and yellow. Write positive or affirming statements on green and misunderstandings on yellow. After the interview, stick the post-its into the cells for the corresponding interviewee and screen. As post-its are in two colours, you can immediately see where are a lot of misunderstandings.
