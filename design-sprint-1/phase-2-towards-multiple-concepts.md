# Phase 2: towards multiple solutions

In the previous phase we determined which role to focus on and looked at the constraints that we want to tackle in this Sprint. Here we want to get to potential solutions for tackling the constraints. These solutions are crude candidates of our MVP.

## Get the creativity flowing with Lightning Demos

Before proceeding to the next exercises, take a moment with the group to invoke some creativity and get inspired by other solutions. With the Sprint Questions in mind we search the Internet for companies, platforms and product that solve a similar challenge and present our findings to the others in quick presentations called Lightning Demos.

> **Exercise Lightning Demos \(10 + 2\*participants mins\)**  
> Draw inspiration from other solutions on how to solve the Sprint Questions.   
> - \[10 mins\] Take 10 minutes to individually look for other platforms that solve the “Can we…” Sprint Questions. These could very well be outside the industry you are looking at for your own platform. For instance, if we make a food delivery service we could look at how postal platforms or taxi platforms solve the problem of ‘delivery’. Write them on rectangular post-its with product name, the idea / learning / solution and some extra details.   
> - \[2 minutes per person\] Present the solutions you found along with how they solve which problem.

## Sketching: a 4-step process

Now its time to make things tangible. This whole exercise is done **together alone**, which is Design Sprint language for individually. There are four steps: Note Taking, Ideas, Crazy Eights, and creating a 3-step concept.

### Note Taking

We get started by taking a moment to inspect all previous findings and write down what we already have. Everyone takes a piece of paper, preferably on a clipboard, and creates an overview of the 2 Year Goal, the Sprint Questions, the Map and your favourite Lightning Demos. This step is really about copying what we already have and not about coming up with new stuff.

> **Exercise Note Taking \(15 mins\)**  
> Take an A4 paper and write down the 2 Year Goal, the Sprint Questions, the Map and Target area and your favourite Lightning Demos. The remainder of the time is spent on writing down any thoughts or ideas that come up.

### **Ideas**

Now we convert parts or our notes into visuals. 

> **Exercise Ideas \(20 mins\)**  
> Repeat until the time has elapsed:  
> **-** Select a part of your notes from the previous step and circle it.   
> - Take an A4 and draw the challenge/problem/assumption/solution of what you circled.

You could draw the step-by-step process or a scenario or scene or anything else. It does not need to be detailed or ‘done’ yet. Also, it does not need to be beautiful \(indicated by our own not-so-beatiful drawing\) as these drawings are not shown to the others.

Below is one of our drawings related to the first Sprint Question. It depicts the full cycle starting with a vacant home put on Airbnb and ending with the Host receiving money and doing groceries. The thought of this idea is to set the price in such a way that the Host can cover its expenses by subletting its house.

### **Crazy Eights**

> **Exercise Crazy Eights \(10 mins\)**  
> Go beyond. \[1 min\] Fold A4 paper 3 times in half so that you end up for 8 boxes if you unfold. \[1 min\] Choose one idea from the previous step that you like to explore further \(circle it\). \[8 mins\] Draw your ideas in eight different ways in the boxes \(1 min per drawing\).

### **3 Step Concept**

> **Exercise 3 Step Concept \(30 mins\)**­  
> Take 3 A4 pages and tape them together into a bigger paper. On each A4 you tape an A5 in the middle. They act like paper Powerpoint slides.­Draw a 3-step story of a solution that solves the target area of the map. Be sure to include solutions you found for the Sprint Questions in Crazy Eights. The drawings usually represent screens of the platform with buttons and images, but it could also be more abstract. As long as the idea is clear.­Post-its can be added for annotations and explanations.­At the end, hang all 3 Step Concepts on the wall.
