# Phase 2: towards multiple concepts

## Map Drawing and Target Setting

We’ll draw a map to visualize the journey of the constrained role. 

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2813%29.png)

* The left arrow contains the role, while the blocks on the right contains an objective based on the 2 Year Goal.
* In the middle, we will add blocks connected by arrows that describe the process towards to objectives. 
*  The middle is divided into three categories: Discover, Learn, and Start. The Discover phase is where the user might find out about the thing/product/service/etc., i.e. a Facebook ad. This is a passive step. The Learn phase is where a user might learn more about it, by actively seeking it out, i.e. a marketing page. The Start phase is a user would take an action to interact with it, i.e. buy it.

After the map has been created, the Facilitator takes a coloured marker. Decide together on an area of the map that will be the scope of the MVP. Keep in mind here the 2 Year Goal and also the touchpoints and services from the Experience Map.

> **Exercise**  
> Work together on a whiteboard with the template below to map out the interaction on the platform from the perspective of the constraining role.   
> - Draw the structure of the map, including the role names on the left and the objective on the right \(see below\).   
> - Take a look at the touchpoints and services from the Experience Map and the direction and contents of the transactions in the Transaction Engine.   
> - Draw blocks with the names of the touchpoints in green and blocks with services in blue. Usually, all blocks fit under the ‘Use’ category, but not always.   
> - In red, draw additional blocks to complete the chain from role to goal \(Discover column is still often empty\).   
> - Connect the blocks by arrows. Use the Transaction Engine for details on what transaction takes place around touchpoints.

## Sketching: a 4-step process \(90 mins\)

Now its time to make things tangible. This whole exercise is done together alone, which is Design Sprint language for individually. There are four steps: Note Taking \(15 mins\), Ideas \(25 mins\), Crazy Eights \(10 mins\), and creating a 3-step concept \(30 mins\).

> **Exercise Note Taking \(15 mins\)**  
> Here we essentially write down what we already have. Take an A4 paper and write down the 2 Year Goal, the Sprint Questions, the Map and Target area and your favourite Lightning Demos. The remainder of the time is spent on writing down any thoughts or ideas that come up.

> **Exercise Ideas \(20 mins\)**  
> Select a part of your notes from the previous step and circle it. Take an A4 and draw the challenge/problem/assumption/solution of what you circled. You could draw the step-by-step process or a scenario or scene or anything else. It does not need to be detailed or ‘done’ yet. When you are done, repeat the exercise and keep drawing.

> **Exercise Crazy Eights \(10 mins\)**  
> Go beyond. \[1 min\] Fold A4 paper 3 times in half so that you end up for 8 boxes if you unfold. \[1 min\] Choose one idea from the previous step that you like to explore further \(circle it\). \[8 mins\] Draw your ideas in eight different ways in the boxes \(1 min per drawing\).

> **Exercise 3 Step Concept \(30 mins\)**­  
> Take 3 A4 pages and tape them together into a bigger paper. On each A4 you tape an A5 in the middle. They act like paper Powerpoint slides.­Draw a 3-step story of a solution that solves the target area of the map. Be sure to include solutions you found for the Sprint Questions in Crazy Eights. The drawings usually represent screens of the platform with buttons and images, but it could also be more abstract. As long as the idea is clear.­Post-its can be added for annotations and explanations.­At the end, hang all 3 Step Concepts on the wall.
