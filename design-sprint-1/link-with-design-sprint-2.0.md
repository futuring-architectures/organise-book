# Link with Design Sprint \(2.0\)

This workshop is based on the Design Sprint pioneered by Jake Knapp and adjusted by [AJ&SMART](https://aj-smart.teachable.com/). It is based on four core principles: Together Alone, Tangible ideas over Discussion, Getting Started over Being Right, and Don’t rely on Creativity. Our aim is to leave the structure of the Design Sprint intact as much as possible while taking into account two things that make our context different.

## 1. Platform ≠ Product

The original Design Sprint is used to prototype and validate products, but we are working with platforms. However, one could see a platform described in the Experience Board as multiple products \(one for each role\) interacting in the same ecosystem and that are linked to each other. Therefore, we decide on one role, called the constrained role, and treat its journey as the product for which we want to do this workshop. We provide a structured approach to select the constrained role right after formulating the Sprint Questions. These Sprint Questions can be seen as the constraints our roles deal with, hence the name constrained role.

## 2. Build upon insights of preceding workshops

The original Design Sprint starts from stratch. However, we already learned a lot about the ecosystem and the platform in [Reveal ](https://reveal.futuring-architectures.com/)and [Position](https://position.futuring-architectures.com/). Therefore, ‘Monday’ of the Design Sprint 2.0 is adjusted to use data that is already available. It would make no sense to discover this information again.
