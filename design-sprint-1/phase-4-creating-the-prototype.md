# Phase 3: putting the MVP on paper

## Concept Voting

> **Exercise Concept Voting**  
> Reread your notes from the Note Taking exercise. Inspect all the Concepts on the wall. Take as many red dots as you like and stick them on all parts of all concepts that you like or you think is a good way to answer the Sprint Questions. This is to prepare a heat-map that helps making the real decisions. Its about registering interest, not about making commitments.

> **Exercise Concept Presentations**  
> The Facilitator will now present all Concepts with a focus on where the dots are. Tell the name of the Concept, the general idea and the parts with a lot of heat. Appoint one Volunteer that writes down 1 – 3 sentences on rectangular post-its for each presentation that the Facilitator gives in the next task. After explanation of a Concept, ask whether anyone voted on this concept for a different reasons. The Volunteers notes are added above the Concept.

> **Exercise Synchronized Voting and Decision \(15 mins\)**  
> After all presentations, all take a good look at the concepts and dots. Decide in your head which concept you think should be prototyped and tested. Take a rectangular post-it. Write down the concept title and reasons for your decision. Everyone takes a green dot and writes their initials on it. Then, at the same time, everyone sticks the dot on the feature or Concept they selected. Everyone presents their decision to the group and the Decider. Finally, the Decider selects one of the Concepts as the main Solution and optionally also parts of other Concepts that are really interesting.

## User Test Flow

> **Exercise User Test Flow**  
> Everyone takes the square post-its. Look back at the ‘winning’ concept. Write 6 story steps that you think are a good way to guide a user through the solution. Tip: use verbs

> **Exercise User Test Flow Voting**  
> Participants stand up in turns and read out their post-its and stick them on the grid as shown below. Every participant votes on the row they think is clearest using a red dot. The Decider makes the final decision using the green dot.

## Storyboarding

> **Exercise Storyboarding \(60 mins\)**  
> Now that we decided on a concept, we should ensure to not leave any open questions for the prototypers.
>
> Appoint a Volunteer that draws the story board. The Facilitator should focus on facilitating. Arrange a big whiteboard and draw 8 cells on it. Take the 6 post-its from the winning User Test flow. Stick the post-its in 6 of the cells.
>
> \[15 mins\] Jointly look at all the Concepts and find drawings you can re-use and stick into the cells. The focus should be on reusing the winning Concept, but feel free to borrow from other Concepts that better represent it. \[30 mins\] Complete the cells by drawing around the Concept parts and add all details. Advice: start with the first, then the last, then the rest.
