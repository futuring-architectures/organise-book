# Phase 1: naming the scope and goals

## Determine the constrained role 

The main relationship is formed by two roles. However, for the MVP, we want to focus on one role’s perspective. Specifically, we want to focus on the constraining role. Platforms are generally either **producer-constrained or consumer-constrained**, depending on who has more influence on the platform. For instance, Uber is a producer-constrained platform, because it’s harder to convince driver to spend their time driving around strangers in their own car and being dependent on Uber for their income than it is to get users order a taxi which they are already used to. On the other hand, OpenTable is a consumer-constrained platform because restaurants are naturally inclined to get more customers while customers have many options to take their money to. 

What is the constraining role in your platform? 

> **Exercise Determining the Constrained Role \(20 mins\)**  
> Put two blue post-its on the wall, write on them ‘producer-constrained’ and ‘consumer-constrained’.  
> ­- \[10 mins\] Decide in your head if the platform is producer- or consumer-constrained.  
> - ­\[5 mins\] One by one, put a red dot on one of the post-its. The Decider cannot vote.­  
> - \[5 mins\] The Decider now decides the constraining side using a green dot.

In our case, Airbnb is a producer-constrained platform, because it’s harder to convince hosts to rent their houses to strangers than it is to get guests to knock on those doors. Therefore, we determine that **the Host is the constrained role** in our case.

## Framing the constrained role's journey as a How Might We

After determining the role that we will focus on, we set the focus for the MVP. Take a look at the journey of the constrained role on the Experience Map. We want to capture this journey in the form on an HMW \(How Might We\) question to reframe the problem that we want to solve as a question. Discussion on the HMW also helps the team align on the context.

> **Exercise HMW \(40 mins\)**  
> Thinking from the constrained role’s perspective, look at the statements in the Ecosystem Relationship Portrait related to this role. Reframe what the role achieves in its journey into a HMW question.   
> - \[15 mins\] Individually, write on rectangular post-its potential candidate questions for the MVP. The question always starts with "How Might We..".  
> - \[15 mins\] Stick all post-its on a wall and then everyone calls out common themes they observe. Work together to cluster HMW’s together and add a blue post-it with the theme.   
> - \[5 mins\] Everyone gets 2 red dots to vote on HMW’s and 4 dots for the Decider.   
> - \[5 mins\] Collect the top 5 and let the Decider select the final HMW.

In our case, looking at the journey of the Host on the Experience Map, we can phrase its journey as:   
_“How might we help a host to present its room to the world, set the price and receive the payments?”._

## Setting a 2 Year Goal for the constrained role

The How Might We is our goal for the MVP that aims to make the constrained role less constrained. Now we need to find out what is actually constraining it. To do that, we first zoom out into the future and imagine a world in which the role is not constrained at all. What will the ideal world look like in 2 years if the constraints would not exist? 

> **Exercise 2 Year Goal \(20 mins\)**  
> Be optimistic and make sure to aim high.   
> - \[5 mins\] Take a look at the Innovation Engine from Position, and in particular the challenges for the constraining role to stand out.   
> - \[5 mins\] Everyone takes a block of rectangular post-its and writes down a sentence in form of “In two years’ time….” + what will happen to the ecosystem.   
> - \[10 mins\] One person at a time, stick the post-it on the wall and read it out loud.   
> - \[5 mins\] Dot vote \(1 red dot each\) on the 2 Year Goal that is most clear and inspirational. The Decider cannot vote.   
> - \[5 mins\] The Decider now decides the 2 Year Goal using a green dot.

In our case, if the Host would not be constrained at all then it would be able to make a living off Airbnb, so we set the goal as follows: in two years time we want to provide a stable primary source of income for 25% of our hosts.

## Naming the constraints through Sprint Questions

Now that we zoomed out, we can more clearly see what could stop us getting to the 2 Year Goal. In other words, what could constrain the role? The challenges from the Innovation Engine of the Position workshop and the key relationship are of great help here, so we make sure to reuse and build upon these insights. Similar to the HMW, these constraints are formulated as a question in order to invoke a more solution-oriented atmosphere in the workshop.

> **Exercise Sprint Questions \(35 mins\)  
> -** \[5 mins\] For the constraining role, take a look at the Innovation Engine from Position, and in particular the challenges for this role to start out and stand firm.­  
> - \[10 mins\] Everyone takes a block of rectangular post-its and writes down 1-3 questions  in form of “Can we...” + risky question / assumption that should be answered / validated.

With our 2 Year Goal in mind we come up with the following three Sprint Questions:

* “Can we offer sufficient primary income to someone that rents out one 2-person accommodation full-time?” 
* “Can we convince Guests to become Hosts?” 
* “Can we offer supporting services to Guests that make them stay on our platform?”

Before proceeding to the next exercises and to close of this phase, take a moment with the group to invoke some creativity and help from the outside. For this we use the Lightning Demos exercise:

> **Exercise Lightning Demos \(10 + 2\*participants mins\)**  
> Draw inspiration from other solutions on how to solve the Sprint Questions.   
> - \[10 mins\] Take 10 minutes to individually look for other platforms that solve the “Can we…” Sprint Questions. These could very well be outside the industry you are looking at for your own platform. For instance, if we make a food delivery service we could look at how postal platforms or taxi platforms solve the problem of ‘delivery’. Write them on rectangular post-its with product name, the idea / learning / solution and some extra details.   
> - \[2 minutes per person\] Present the solutions you found along with how they solve which problem.
